1. SOAP is not "simple", but more complex. My opinion.
2. There are **rules** to form HTTP **Request/Response**.
3. In **SOAP** **Start Line**
    - First we need to use **POST**.
    - Second we need use **WSDL**.
    - Third is **HTTP Version**.
4. XML in the body, which is generated using **WSDL**.

- **W3C**, is creator if **SOAP** and **WSDL**.
